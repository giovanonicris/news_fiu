1,private credit,KKR executives see nothing alarming in credit default rise - Reuters,"KKR Chief Financial Officer Rob Lewin described the environment for monetizations, meaning selling or refinancing assets in its portfolio as ""constructive"" and said the U.S. private equity firm expects this to continue into 2026.
KKR avoided some of that during the period of very low rates, having learned lessons from over-investing before the global financial crisis, Co-Chief Executive Scott Nuttall said.
Market sentiment was currently ""closer to the high anxiety end"" on private equity fundraising and private credit risk, Nuttall said, adding that although public and private credit defaults had picked up, there was ""nothing alarming going on"".
KKR executives said on the call that the firm had no exposure to auto parts supplier First Brands or car dealership Tricolor, whose bankruptcies have rattled debt markets.
