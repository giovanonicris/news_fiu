1,private credit,Move Over State Street. JPMorgan Becomes Latest to File for Private Credit ETF - Yahoo Finance,"This week, J.P. Morgan Asset Management got in line to be the next ETF issuer dabbling in private credit.
The firm filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval of its Total Credit ETF, a product that would allocate up to 15% of assets to private credit.
“An aggressive client portfolio currently contains between 5% to 10% private credit via [business development companies] for high yield,” he said.
The company’s filing did not include fees, though the SPDR SSGA IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV) charges 0.7% and its second fund, State Street Short Duration IG Public & Private Credit ETF, which launched last month, charges 0.59%.
That’s not a verdict on the hotly anticipated category, but retail investors aren’t exactly piling into private credit ETFs yet.","jpmorgan, latest, file, private, credit, etf, state, street, public, asset, management, funds, increasingly, week, j, p, morgan, market, markets, etfs, aren’t, portfolio, million, retail, firm, filed, product, assets, yield, investors, filing, high, capital, stock, reached",2025-10-01,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/move-over-state-street-jpmorgan-100500430.html,yahoo finance,positive,0.4343,2025-10-03 09:25:53
