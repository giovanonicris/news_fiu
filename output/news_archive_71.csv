1,private credit,UK banks push for easing of capital rules to counter surge in private credit - Financial Times,"British banks are losing ground to less constrained private credit groups and Wall Street rivals, two bosses have claimed to senior lawmakers.
This has prompted concern among regulators, who have less oversight of private credit groups, as well as among bankers.

Roberts said US deregulation would increase pressure on UK authorities to ease rules for British banks.
Roberts called on regulators to force private credit groups to disclose much more information.","push, easing, counter, surge, private, credit, banks, capital, rules, uk, groups, bank, loans, regulators, british, requirements, companies, roberts, lending, senior, hsbc, lenders, cent, dainton, scale, level, wall, street, barclays, regulation, subject, bankers, england, review, 2008",2025-11-11,https://www.ft.com/content/f29a8e65-4d9d-4614-86d3-75fb74233e6d,financial times,positive,0.0611,2025-11-12 09:35:10
