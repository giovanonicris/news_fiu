Thursday's gains follow last week's launch of tokenized versions of more than 100 U.S.-listed stocks, ETFs, and other equities on Ethereum via the DeFi protocol's Global Markets platform.
That all but “underscores the project’s strong early traction,” Yuen said.

1,private credit,Former Goldman Sachs CEO during 2008 crash says markets are 'due' for a crisis - Fortune,"He added that plenty of assets are being placed in insurers as a way for those companies to generate higher yields on long-term liabilities.
Risks of the U.S. private credit market Blankfein’s concerns about the narrowing of credit spreads and the continuing swell of private credit speak to potentially hidden risks.
Credit spreads are at their tightest in about 20 years, meaning there is little difference in yields between corporate bonds compared to government bonds.
Private credit has similarly boomed, becoming a $1.7 trillion-dollar industry, as higher interest rates lead to higher yields for investors.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned in July that private credit could become a “recipe for a financial crisis.”","goldman, sachs, ceo, 2008, crash, crisis, markets, credit, private, risks, blankfein, spreads, higher, yields, risk, rates, interview, assets, long-term, there’s, it’s, warned, debt, market, s, corporate, bonds, lead, investors, cnbc’s, squawk, box, listed, potential, lurking",2025-09-12,https://fortune.com/2025/09/12/goldman-sachs-ceo-lloyd-blankfein-financial-crisis-private-credit/,fortune,positive,0.1986,2025-09-18 09:27:34
