1,private credit,"In private credit, banks are ‘quietly preparing for some distress on the horizon’ by requiring ever-stricter legal terms - Fortune","Lenders to corporate America—often big banks generating broadly syndicated loans that are sold on public markets—are getting stricter with their borrowers on a range of legal issues inside private credit deals, Noetica’s data indicates.
“What the data supports is that lenders are quietly preparing for some distress on the horizon, and we see that in the data with the increasing structural protections existing in new credit deals,” he told Fortune.
Back in 2023, only 4% of private credit deals tracked by Noetica contained anti-Petsmart language.
Over the same time periods, Noetica’s database of thousands of private credit contracts indicates that borrowers got more leeway to make investments, pay dividends, and more generous terms in how they calculate their EBITDA.
Wertman is careful to say he does not know why private credit deal terms are getting stricter, just that they are.","banks, quietly, preparing, distress, horizon, requiring, ever-stricter, legal, credit, private, terms, deals, lenders, creditors, data, j, company, noetica, borrowers, fortune, crew, debt, noetica’s, language, wertman, told, companies, refers, million, entity, reach, older, blocker, deal, q3",2025-11-02,https://fortune.com/2025/11/02/private-credit-banks-preparing-distress-horizon-strict-legal-terms/,fortune,positive,0.6767,2025-11-03 09:31:27
