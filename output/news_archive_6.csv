Tokenized equities are digital tokens issued on blockchains that represent exposure to a company's stock but do not grant actual ownership or voting rights.
Despite claims of cheaper transactions, faster settlement, and 24/7 accessibility, the WFE said the products risk confusing investors.
A U.S. SEC commissioner stated in July that tokenized securities must comply with existing rules.
Coinbase COIN is also seeking approval from the SEC to roll out tokenized equities in the U.S., Reuters previously reported.","global, crosshairs, happened, coinbase, nasdaq, coin, tokenized, equities, exchanges, stock, wfe, securities, products, shares, tokens, s, sec, federation, regulators, investors, task, force, esma, iosco, marketed, traditional, rights, trading, ownership, offering, stocks, declined, firms, read, comment",2025-08-25,https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/08/47316344/tokenized-equities-in-the-crosshairs-of-global-stock-exchanges-what-happened,benzinga,negative,-0.3674,2025-08-26 09:45:40
1,private credit,BlackRock's $1B Asia Credit Fund Hits Pause Amid HPS Deal and Rising Market Risks - Yahoo Finance,"BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has hit pause on fundraising for its third Asia-Pacific private credit fund after announcing the acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December, with the deal officially closing on July 1.
The $1 billion fund, launched in late 2023, had secured less than half of its target before the pause as internal discussions with HPS executives continue on how to align strategy going forward.
The pause comes against a more challenging backdrop for the $1.7 trillion global private credit market.
That puts private credit defaults broadly in line with the syndicated loan market and has raised concerns among some investors about potential risks that may not yet be fully priced in.
The firm recently ended its private credit partnership with Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co. after facing difficulties sourcing deals, underscoring ongoing headwinds in the region.","1b, asia, hits, amid, rising, credit, hps, pause, fund, blackrock's, deal, market, risks, private, blk, fundraising, billion, investors, gurufocus, asia-pacific, acquisition, investment, internal, strategy, talks, warning, article, appeared, blackrock, nyse, hit, announcing, partners, officially, closing",2025-08-25,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrocks-1b-asia-credit-fund-153616860.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.3777,2025-08-27 09:27:45
