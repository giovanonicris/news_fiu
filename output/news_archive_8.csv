1,private credit,How Private Equity Funds Understate the Risk in Their Investments - Morningstar,"Volatility laundering, a term coined by AQR’s Cliff Asness, describes how private equity funds systematically understate the actual risk in their investments.
Private equity holdings are typically valued only quarterly, and these valuations often rely on models and assumptions rather than real-time market pricing.
Note that this should not be interpreted to mean that private equity is one-third as risky as public equity, but the multiples have been 3 times as volatile.
This doesn’t necessarily make private equity (or private credit or private real estate) a poor investment choice.
However, it does mean investors relying on smoothed return data are likely underestimating their risk exposure (more so in private equity than in private credit).","understate, investments, private, equity, risk, funds, volatility, public, investors, multiples, markets, ebitda, returns, valuations, credit, real, lower, assets, reits, cclfx, higher, market, capital, daily, estate, laundering, price, valuation, smoothing, data, reported, standard, lagged, s, p",2025-08-28,https://www.morningstar.com/alternative-investments/how-private-equity-funds-understate-risk-their-investments,morningstar,negative,-0.5821,2025-08-28 09:28:30
