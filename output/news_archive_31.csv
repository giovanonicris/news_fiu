6, non-bank lending,US debt investors raise alarm over lending standards - Financial Times,"US debt investors have raised the alarm over lax lending standards in credit markets after the unravelling of two companies that just weeks ago were deemed to be in strong health.
One investor who sold out of Tricolor debt last week said the collapse of the company and ensuing market turmoil was one of the “worst things I’ve ever seen in the asset-backed securities” market.
Both companies made use of asset-backed debt, with Tricolor bundling up subprime car loans into bonds and First Brands tapping specialist funds to provide credit against its invoices.
Asset-backed credit is not a new product, but it is rapidly evolving, as titans on Wall Street such as Apollo Global Management and KKR devise new ways to lend.
The development had been a boon for non-bank lenders such as Tricolor, which used demand for car-loan backed bonds to turbocharge its lending.","raise, alarm, standards, investors, debt, lending, tricolor, brands, lenders, credit, asset-backed, financing, loans, companies, banks, week, collapse, company, finance, deals, jpmorgan, raised, markets, subprime, auto, sheet, crisis, questions, investor, market, funds, loan, including, investment, comment",2025-09-24,https://www.ft.com/content/cdb5ad3e-1c11-48af-9852-00ccc147abbf,financial times,negative,-0.1143,2025-09-27 09:40:13
