That saying is now being echoed by the top brass of the financial world, with big banks to regional players taking substantial loan loss charges this week amid Quick Insights Recent bankruptcies such as Tricolor Holdings have led major banks like JPMorgan and others to take substantial loan loss charges and highlight exposure to unsustainable debts and potentially fraudulent activities.
Despite market nerves and sharp sell-offs, these loan losses are currently viewed as isolated and not fully representative of a systemic banking crisis, though vigilance is warranted.
Banking troubles have caused Treasury yields to fall sharply, the Fed's repo facility to be used, broad equity sell-offs across regions, and signals of illiquidity in money markets.

“Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support.
