1,private credit,Default Warnings Start to Pile Up in Private Credit Market - Yahoo Finance,"Warnings on defaults are starting to pile up in the $1.7 trillion private credit market, prompting at least some analysts to raise concern about underappreciated risks in one of Wall Street’s favorite money spinners.
While there is no universal definition of what constitutes default in private credit, default rates for the market are currently in the 2% to 3% range.
The adjustment puts the default rate for private credit broadly in line with that observed in the broadly syndicated loan market.
Returns above 8% are still luring investment, although private credit funds are not the cash magnet they once were.
“A major selling point of private credit is the low default rates,” Bukhari wrote in a report this month.","start, private, credit, default, market, warnings, pile, lenders, analysts, losses, cash, month, jpmorgan, report, defaults, trillion, borrowers, companies, billion, debt, including, definition, rates, rate, broadly, asset, inflows, wrote, bukhari, starting, prompting, raise, concern, underappreciated, risks",2025-08-22,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/default-warnings-start-pile-private-000726256.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.689,2025-08-22 20:53:20

OpenAI alone estimates it will need trillions of dollars over time to spend on the infrastructure required to develop and run artificial intelligence services.
At the same time, key players in the industry acknowledge there is probably pain ahead for AI investors.
OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said this week that he sees parallels between the current investment frenzy in artificial intelligence and the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s.

Tokenized equities are digital tokens issued on blockchains that represent exposure to a company's stock but do not grant actual ownership or voting rights.
Despite claims of cheaper transactions, faster settlement, and 24/7 accessibility, the WFE said the products risk confusing investors.
A U.S. SEC commissioner stated in July that tokenized securities must comply with existing rules.

1,private credit,Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Raises Alarm Over $2 Trillion Industry's Influence on Wall Street - Investopedia,"In July 2025, Dimon described private credit as potentially “dangerous,” drawing parallels to the loose lending that preceded the 2008 financial crisis.
How Investors Should Navigate the Private Credit Minefield Unlike traditional banks, private credit funds operate largely outside the rigorous oversight that governs deposit-taking institutions.
Consider strengthening cash flows, limiting nonessential expenditures, and securing backup credit facilities if concerns about a private credit market squeeze increase.
The Bottom Line The private credit industry's explosive growth to $2 trillion represents both opportunity and significant risk.
Jamie Dimon's warnings suggest that private credit could face a reckoning, and the question is whether the broader economy is prepared for the fallout.","raises, alarm, industry's, influence, street, dimon, jamie, wall, jpmorgan, trillion, private, credit, growth, investors, banks, market, ceo, crisis, loans, 2025, hall, returns, lending, traditional, managers, bond, markets, loose, financing, means, businesses, oversight, equity, firms, risky",2025-08-26,https://www.investopedia.com/why-private-credit-has-jamie-dimon-scared-11779250,investopedia,positive,0.8332,2025-08-27 09:27:32

(NYSE:BLK) has hit pause on fundraising for its third Asia-Pacific private credit fund after announcing the acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December, with the deal officially closing on July 1.
The $1 billion fund, launched in late 2023, had secured less than half of its target before the pause as internal discussions with HPS executives continue on how to align strategy going forward.
The pause comes against a more challenging backdrop for the $1.7 trillion global private credit market.
That puts private credit defaults broadly in line with the syndicated loan market and has raised concerns among some investors about potential risks that may not yet be fully priced in.

1,private credit,How Private Equity Funds Understate the Risk in Their Investments - Morningstar,"Volatility laundering, a term coined by AQR’s Cliff Asness, describes how private equity funds systematically understate the actual risk in their investments.
Private equity holdings are typically valued only quarterly, and these valuations often rely on models and assumptions rather than real-time market pricing.
Note that this should not be interpreted to mean that private equity is one-third as risky as public equity, but the multiples have been 3 times as volatile.
This doesn’t necessarily make private equity (or private credit or private real estate) a poor investment choice.
However, it does mean investors relying on smoothed return data are likely underestimating their risk exposure (more so in private equity than in private credit).","understate, investments, private, equity, risk, funds, volatility, public, investors, multiples, markets, ebitda, returns, valuations, credit, real, lower, assets, reits, cclfx, higher, market, capital, daily, estate, laundering, price, valuation, smoothing, data, reported, standard, lagged, s, p",2025-08-28,https://www.morningstar.com/alternative-investments/how-private-equity-funds-understate-risk-their-investments,morningstar,negative,-0.5821,2025-08-28 09:28:30
