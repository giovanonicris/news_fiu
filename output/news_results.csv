1,private credit,Default Warnings Start to Pile Up in Private Credit Market - Yahoo Finance,"Warnings on defaults are starting to pile up in the $1.7 trillion private credit market, prompting at least some analysts to raise concern about underappreciated risks in one of Wall Street’s favorite money spinners.
While there is no universal definition of what constitutes default in private credit, default rates for the market are currently in the 2% to 3% range.
The adjustment puts the default rate for private credit broadly in line with that observed in the broadly syndicated loan market.
Returns above 8% are still luring investment, although private credit funds are not the cash magnet they once were.
“A major selling point of private credit is the low default rates,” Bukhari wrote in a report this month.","start, private, credit, default, market, warnings, pile, lenders, analysts, losses, cash, month, jpmorgan, report, defaults, trillion, borrowers, companies, billion, debt, including, definition, rates, rate, broadly, asset, inflows, wrote, bukhari, starting, prompting, raise, concern, underappreciated, risks",2025-08-22,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/default-warnings-start-pile-private-000726256.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.689,2025-08-22 20:53:20
