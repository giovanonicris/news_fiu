That tokenized real estate offering 7% should be offering 5.5% in a connected market.

1,private credit,"Liquid Credit’s Woes Are Good for Private Lenders, Ares Says - Yahoo Finance","Recent failures in the credit markets, including First Brands Group and Tricolor Holdings, have fueled a frenzy around how much risk is sitting in private debt portfolios.
But for Ares Management Corp. executives, the losses actually make private credit look good, while presenting an opportunity to snag more deals.
“That’s a great time for private credit.” Issues for First Brands arose after the auto-part maker tried to refinance its debt in the broadly syndicated market, but failed to clinch a transaction and lenders requested a quality of earnings report.
Private credit firms are asking for a quality of earnings report for every new transaction, Schnabel said.
Investors have also been waiting for BDCs — a popular structure for direct lenders to pool their private credit loans — to report earnings and offer insight into the health of portfolios.","liquid, credit’s, woes, private, ares, good, lenders, credit, market, earnings, brands, broadly, syndicated, direct, report, documents, lending, recent, markets, debt, portfolios, corp, deals, schnabel, chief, company, weeks, transaction, quality, million, failures, including, group, tricolor, holdings",2025-10-29,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liquid-credit-wobbles-good-private-230800366.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.5765,2025-10-31 09:31:09
3, stock tokenization,Robinhood's CEO Just Predicted Tokenization Will Eat The Whole Financial System—But Private Companies Aren't Ready For What Comes Next - Yahoo Finance,"But getting there requires solving problems that have nothing to do with technology and everything to do with convincing skeptical private companies to embrace real-time price discovery.
Robinhood pursued being the first to tokenize shares of OpenAI and SpaceX, and is now working closely with private companies to ensure tokenization is welcomed rather than feared.
According to Tenev, customer demand is crystal clear—retail investors want private market access, and it’s poised to become a “big market.” But Tenev acknowledges the road ahead isn’t smooth.
“The tokenization of private companies is still quite early,” he said, pointing to significant hurdles with both regulators and the companies themselves.
The Private Company Problem: Why Real-Time Trading Scares Founders Here’s the tension at the heart of Tenev’s vision: some private companies “don’t like their stocks being traded in real time 24/7,” Tenev told CNBC.","robinhood's, ceo, predicted, eat, system, ready, private, tokenization, companies, tenev, investors, robinhood, capital, tenev’s, vision, market, company, earn, poised, global, markets, retail, trading, shares, openai, spacex, buying, traded, stocks, real-time, price, discovery, accredited, entrepreneurship, formation",2025-10-29,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhoods-ceo-just-predicted-tokenization-164952701.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.1993,2025-11-01 09:34:02
1,private credit,Ignoring Reality or Overreacting? Semiliquid Funds Versus BDCs - Morningstar,"In the other reside semiliquid funds (including unlisted BDCs), which often employ similar lending strategies, but in more restrictive structures.
Is this an early sign of trouble for semiliquid private credit funds?
The performance of listed BDCs, they may argue, therefore, has little relevance to their semiliquid funds, as each portfolio is supposedly unique.
These companies allocate many of the same deals to both their semiliquid funds and listed BDCs.
Otherwise, it points to the conclusion that semiliquid funds’ infrequent pricing is not a bug, but instead their main feature.","ignoring, reality, overreacting, versus, bdcs, funds, semiliquid, credit, listed, private, nav, market, fund, discount, companies, trade, managers, capital, losses, holdings, investors, portfolios, average, information, returns, lending, 20, portfolio, bdc, typically, asset, universes, overlap, sell, net",2025-10-29,https://www.morningstar.com/funds/ignoring-reality-or-overreacting-semiliquid-funds-versus-bdcs,morningstar,neutral,-0.0004,2025-11-02 09:28:03
