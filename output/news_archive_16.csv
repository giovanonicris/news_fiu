The exchange, which lists Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants, would give customers the option of trading securities via traditional digital representation of ownership with or without blockchain backing.
In June, Robinhood rolled out trading for European users of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds as tokens on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.
In May, crypto exchange Kraken announced its own tokenization plans through a partnership with Backed, using the Solana blockchain.

2,securities tokenization,World's Biggest Stock Exchanges Call for Crackdown on 'Fake' Tokenized Stocks—And Why Coinbase And Robinhood Should Be Worried - Yahoo Finance,"The industry group argued that tokenized equities “mimic” traditional stocks without providing the same investor protections or trading safeguards.
The exchanges’ concern centers on a fundamental disconnect: while tokenized stocks represent ownership of securities, investors don’t actually become shareholders in the underlying company.
If investors can trade tokenized versions of stocks on crypto platforms with lower fees and 24/7 availability, it could siphon volume away from traditional exchanges.
An SEC commissioner said in July that tokenized securities must still meet securities regulations, but clearer guidance hasn’t emerged.

6, non-bank lending,Non-Recourse vs. Recourse Debt Explained: Definitions and Examples - Investopedia,"Unlike recourse debt, where lenders can seek out borrowers to cover any remaining debt after seizing collateral, non-recourse loans offer more borrower protection.
What Sets Non-Recourse Debt Apart?
Non-recourse debt is riskier for lenders than recourse debt, especially if the collateral's value drops below the amount owed.
Recourse debt lets lenders seek more money from borrowers if collateral doesn't cover the debt.

Cesar Pereira, who serves as VP of Business Development for Kadena Labs, says tokenized stocks are unlikely to gain traction, while private credit could be the breakout use case that defines the next wave of adoption.
Unlike equities, the private credit market has long suffered from slow processes, opacity, and heavy friction.
So the full life cycle of that private credit is now on blockchain in real time.” He described this shift as an “inflection point” for tokenization, with adoption increasing significantly as institutions search for more efficient ways to manage credit.
Treasuries and other real world assets have already gained momentum on chain, but Pereira sees private credit as the category most likely to accelerate next.","unlock, transparency, growth, exec, credit, private, tokenization, kadena, pereira, equities, real, asset, tokenized, stocks, tokenize, digital, assets, today, shift, adoption, ownership, legal, chain, blockchain, hottest, trends, class, benefits, equally, cesar, serves, vp, business, development, labs",2025-09-08,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tokenization-private-credit-could-unlock-191409868.html,yahoo finance,positive,0.9043,2025-09-13 09:25:17
