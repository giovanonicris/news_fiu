2,securities tokenization,"BlackRock’s Tokenized ETFs Are Only The Beginning, CEO Says - Yahoo Finance","Investment giant BlackRock, which boasts more than $13 trillion in assets under management, has made tokenized ETFs a top priority, CEO Larry Fink confirmed on an earnings call last week.
Another roadblock is the lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity safeguards, Kaplan added, particularly if on-chain assets are going to be held digitally by a custodian.
“Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support.
“When it comes to securities, you have to have the proper licenses and the technology to conduct such activities,” he said.
“Initial use cases will be ETFs of bundles of underlying cryptocurrencies,” Kaplan said.","blackrock’s, beginning, ceo, etfs, tokenized, etf, on-chain, kaplan, assets, issuers, tokenization, regulatory, technology, securities, blockchain, upside, products, fink, crypto, industry, rapidly, required, tokenize, traditional, decentralized, finance, transactions, lack, stocks, legal, subscribe, receive, free, newsletter, digital",2025-10-20,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-tokenized-etfs-only-beginning-101000859.html,yahoo finance,positive,0.5259,2025-10-21 09:35:46
