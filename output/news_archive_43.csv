1,private credit,Is Private Credit Drowning in Capital? These Are the Strategic Implications for Investors - Morningstar,"The private credit market has grown rapidly since the global financial crisis of 2007-08.
To address whether private credit faces a capital glut, Aksia’s research team analyzed its proprietary database covering more than 630 distinct private credit managers and the financial metrics of more than 40,000 private credit loans.

Add its opaque disclosures, and lenders refused to restructure First Brands’ debt terms in September, leading to its Oct. 5, 2025, bankruptcy filing.
