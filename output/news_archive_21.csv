1,private credit,Public/Private Market Convergence And The Limits Of Liquidity - Seeking Alpha,"Sep. 13, 2025 4:40 AM ETVPC AllianceBernstein (AB) 4.91K Follower s Summary The financial media has been filled with headlines about the growing convergence of public and private markets, particularly in private credit.
Following the massive growth of the private credit market, mega-cap private credit deals and broadly syndicated loans are increasingly interchangeable borrowing tools for large-cap issuers.
In our view, the desire to trade private credit is not aimed at creating a generalized secondary market; rather, we see it as an attempt to syndicate large investment-grade private loans to institutions that can hold them for a long time.
The financial media has been filled with headlines about the growing convergence of public and private markets, particularly in private credit.

In contrast, secondary markets for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) are only just emerging.
