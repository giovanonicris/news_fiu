2,securities tokenization,ASIC Chief Warns Australia Risks Losing Edge as Global Markets Embrace Tokenization - Yahoo Finance,"Australia risks losing its competitive edge in global capital markets as other jurisdictions accelerate tokenization of financial assets, with the nation's securities regulator warning that inertia could force Australian issuers and investors offshore.
While other countries rapidly embrace blockchain-based market infrastructure, Australian institutions remain ""too comfortable with the status quo,” Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chair Joe Longo said, while speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday.
""Once, Australia was one of the early adopters of innovation in markets... Now, other countries are outpacing us.""
Distributed ledger technology allows new players to “offer financial market services and challenge the status quo,” he added.
Longo’s concerns come as industry leaders in the U.S, including former TD Ameritrade chair Joe Moglia, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, predict a global shift toward tokenization, while EU markets chief Natasha Cazenave has cautioned that the transformation must be matched with strong investor safeguards.","warns, losing, edge, australia, tokenization, global, markets, risks, embrace, chief, asic, chair, market, longo, assets, regulator, australian, investors, opportunity, capital, securities, countries, status, quo, joe, speaking, players, vallas, ceo, longo’s, strong, larger, clear, moving, tokenized",2025-11-06,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asic-chief-warns-australia-risks-123951048.html,yahoo finance,negative,-0.0895,2025-11-07 09:34:05
3, stock tokenization,US officials weigh proposal that would revolutionize cryptocurrency: 'May be nearing a major inflection point' - Yahoo Finance,"Companies have already expressed interest in stock tokenization in recent months.
Coinbase is reportedly seeking approval from the SEC to offer tokenized equities, while the Nasdaq has asked for approval to change a rule that would let it list tokenized securities, per Cointelegraph.
Meanwhile, crypto exchanges Kraken and Robinhood have reportedly already begun offering tokenized stocks on their platforms.
However, not every business is thrilled by the prospect of crypto stocks, as traditional finance companies have pushed back against the idea.
